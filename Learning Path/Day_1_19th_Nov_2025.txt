Sourashis Ghosh Roy – My Learning Summary

My part of the learning focused more on the database and data-management process
    1. Firebase Realtime Database Structure:
    I learned that the Firebase Realtime Database is essentially a big JSON tree.
    To store user profiles properly, I had to understand:
        how to structure paths like users/<uid>
        how .child() and .set() work
        that Firebase stores everything as JSON-like documents
    This helped me store name, age, phone, and PAN info during registration.

    2. Writing Additional User Data:
    I learned that registering a user in Firebase Auth does not automatically store profile details.
    So I needed to:
        generate my own profile object
        push it manually to the database
        link it to the user’s uid
    Understanding the separation between Auth and Database was important.

    3. Handling Sensitive Fields:
    Because PAN, phone numbers, and personal details were involved, I learned how to structure and store them safely.
    I also learned:
        to avoid printing sensitive data in logs
        to keep API keys out of source control
        to never store credentials in plain text beyond what Firebase requires
    This made me more aware of basic application security.

    4. Error Handling & Debugging:
    I learned to handle errors coming from Firebase, such as:
        invalid passwords
        email already used
        weak passwords
        malformed requests
    Understanding these allowed me to display clear messages instead of confusing Pyrebase stack traces.

    5. Designing a Clean Workflow:
    I learned how to structure a clean registration flow:
        collect user inputs
        create the Firebase account
        retrieve the user’s uid
        push the extra data to the database
        confirm that everything succeeded
    This ensured the registration process stayed reliable and easy to follow.
