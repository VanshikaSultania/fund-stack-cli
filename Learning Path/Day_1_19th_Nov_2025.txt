Sourashis Ghosh Roy – Learning Summary

My part of the learning focused more on the database and data-management process
    1. Firebase Realtime Database Structure:
    I learned that the Firebase Realtime Database is essentially a big JSON tree.
    To store user profiles properly, I had to understand:
        how to structure paths like users/<uid>
        how .child() and .set() work
        that Firebase stores everything as JSON-like documents
    This helped me store name, age, phone, and PAN info during registration.

    2. Writing Additional User Data:
    I learned that registering a user in Firebase Auth does not automatically store profile details.
    So I needed to:
        generate my own profile object
        push it manually to the database
        link it to the user’s uid
    Understanding the separation between Auth and Database was important.

    3. Handling Sensitive Fields:
    Because PAN, phone numbers, and personal details were involved, I learned how to structure and store them safely.
    I also learned:
        to avoid printing sensitive data in logs
        to keep API keys out of source control
        to never store credentials in plain text beyond what Firebase requires
    This made me more aware of basic application security.

    4. Error Handling & Debugging:
    I learned to handle errors coming from Firebase, such as:
        invalid passwords
        email already used
        weak passwords
        malformed requests
    Understanding these allowed me to display clear messages instead of confusing Pyrebase stack traces.

    5. Designing a Clean Workflow:
    I learned how to structure a clean registration flow:
        collect user inputs
        create the Firebase account
        retrieve the user’s uid
        push the extra data to the database
        confirm that everything succeeded
    This ensured the registration process stayed reliable and easy to follow.

Vanshika Sultania - Learning Summary

Before starting this project, I had to understand a set of core concepts to make sure I could properly build the authentication and data-handling parts of the system.
    1. Python Project Structure & Modules:
    I learned how to split a Python project into multiple files, such as:
        modules for authentication
        modules for Firebase configuration
        a CLI controller
        the main entry point
        I needed to understand how Python imports work and how functions interact across files.

    2. Working With CLI Input
    I learned how to:
        collect user input using input()
        create menus using loops
        validate user-entered data
        display meaningful messages
    This was important because the whole system runs in the terminal without a graphical interface.

    3. Firebase Authentication Basics
    I studied Firebase Auth well enough to understand:
        how user registration works
        how login tokens are returned
        what the localId (UID) means
        what errors Firebase returns if something goes wrong
    This helped me map each login and register event to the corresponding Firebase actions.

    4. Pyrebase Library
    I learned how Pyrebase acts as a wrapper around Firebase’s REST API.
    I had to understand:
        how to initialize Firebase using a config dictionary
        how auth.sign_in_with_email_and_password() works
        how Pyrebase returns dictionaries containing tokens and user IDs
    This knowledge was essential for both authentication and database operations.

    5. Secure Handling of User Session Data
    I learned that Firebase returns an ID token, but Pyrebase can simplify validation for me.
    I also learned:
        how to store session data in a local .json file
        how to read it to see if a user is already logged in
        how to clear that session when logging out
    This helped replicate a basic login persistence experience.
